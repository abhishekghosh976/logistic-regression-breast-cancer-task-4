# 🧠 Logistic Regression on Breast Cancer Dataset

This project implements a **binary classification** model using **Logistic Regression** on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Scale features using StandardScaler
- Train a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluate the model with accuracy scores

---

## 📂 Dataset Source

- [UCI ML Repository - Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

---

## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

---

## 🚀 Steps Performed

1. Loaded the dataset and removed nulls/unnecessary columns
2. Encoded the target variable (`M = 1`, `B = 0`)
3. Split data into train/test sets (80/20)
4. Scaled features using `StandardScaler`
5. Trained a `LogisticRegression` model
6. Printed training and testing accuracy
